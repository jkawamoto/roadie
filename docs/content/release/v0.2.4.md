### Added
- Support a new URL scheme `roadie://` which is a shortcut to
  `gs://<your bucket>/.roadie/<section>` in script files.

For example, a URL `roadie://sample.dat` in `data` section of your script file,
will be treated as `gs://<your bucket>/.roadie/data/sample.dat`.
It will reduce your types to make script files.
