A easy way to run your programs on [Google Cloud Platform](https://cloud.google.com/) and [Microsoft Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/).

See [documents](https://jkawamoto.github.io/roadie/) for more information.

## Description
Roadie helps you to upload your source codes to the cloud, create and delete
instances, and manage outputs.

For example,

```sh
$ roadie run --local . --name analyze-wowah script.yml
```

uploads your source codes in current directory, and run them in such a manner
that `script.yml` specifies. The `script.yml` is a simple YAML file like

```yaml
apt:
- unrar
data:
- http://mmnet.iis.sinica.edu.tw/dl/wowah/wowah.rar
run:
- unrar x -r wowah.rar
- analyze WoWAH
```

The above `script.yml` asks roadie to install apt package `unrar` and
download a data file from such URL as the preparation. Then, it directs
to run those two commands: unrar the downloaded file, analyze the obtained
data files.

Roadie uploads results of such commands to a cloud storage after they finish.
You can access those results by

```sh
$ roadie result get analyze-wowah "*" -o ./res
```

Then, Roadie downloads all result files into `./res` directory.

## Installation
